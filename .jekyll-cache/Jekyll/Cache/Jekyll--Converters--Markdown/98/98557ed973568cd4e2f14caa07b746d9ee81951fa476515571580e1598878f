I"f<p>Hello again and welcome to the first in the multi-part series: Building a blog site.</p>

<p>In this series we’ll be looking at how one can build their own blog site through varying degrees of effort, cost, and technical experience. We’ll cover building a quick and simple site hosted on Github pages, right the way through to a self hosted cloud based blog site complete with custom domain, deployment pipeline and automatic package updates for added security.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Editors Note:</em></strong>  Throughout this series we will be using the phrase “Blog site” but the learnings in this series will apply to any Jekyll based site.</p>

<p>In Part 1: On the cheap cheap, we’ll cover how you can build a simple Jekyll based blog site, hosted for free on Github pages, without needing to know anything about coding or software development. All you’ll need is a computer, a <a href="https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&amp;ref_loc=header+logged+out&amp;ref_page=%2F&amp;source=header-home">Github account</a> and a little bit of knowledge about <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>
<p>Before we delve too far into building the site, you first need to ask yourselves <em>“What sort of blog site do I want?”</em>. Do you even want to build a blog? Perhaps you want a portfolio of your photography, an online CV with demos of your work, or maybe you just want a small single page site with a little bit of text. In the end, what you decide upon will determine how much work and time is required to get your site up and running, so it’s best to answer sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t rush, take your time. Think about it over a cup of tea or coffee, I’ll still be here when you’ve decided</strong>.</p>

<p>If after such contemplation you have decided you only want/need a single page that’s awesome. This will be much quicker and easier for you. I’d recommend checking out Github’s very own <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">step-by-step guide</a>. It contains everything you need to know to get your site up and running using one of their curated single page jekyll themes. Follow this and you’ll have your content hosted in no time.</p>

<p>For my Blog, Portfolio and CV peeps, <em>or those who don’t like the Github themes</em>, let’s keep going.</p>

<h2 id="choose-your-theme">Choose your theme!</h2>

<p>If you’re anything like me you feel that aesthetics are important, <em>perhaps overly so</em>. That is why I find the best way to start your blog site is to do a little theme shopping. If you want you can just Google <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jekyll+themes">jekyll themes</a> but if you don’t want to browse through a bunch of dodgy sites, here’s a few I searched earlier…</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">http://jekyllthemes.org/</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">https://jekyllthemes.io/free</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/free/">https://jekyll-themes.com/free/</a></li>
</ul>
