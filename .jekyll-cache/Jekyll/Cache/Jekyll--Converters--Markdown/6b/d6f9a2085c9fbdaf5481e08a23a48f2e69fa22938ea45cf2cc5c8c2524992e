I"„<p>Hello again and welcome to the first in the multi-part series: Building a blog site.</p>

<p>In this series weâ€™ll be looking at how one can build their own blog site through varying degrees of effort, cost, and technical experience. Weâ€™ll cover building a quick and simple site hosted on Github pages, right the way through to a self hosted cloud based blog site complete with custom domain, deployment pipeline and automatic package updates for added security.</p>

<p>In Part 1: On the cheap cheap, weâ€™ll cover how you can build a simple Jekyll based blog site, hosted for free on Github pages, without needing to know anything about coding or software development. All youâ€™ll need is a computer, a Github account and a little bit of knowledge about Markdown.</p>

<h2 id="before-we-begin">Before we begin</h2>
<p>Before we delve too far into building the site, you first need to ask yourselves â€œWhat sort of blog site do I want?â€. Do you even want to build a blog? Perhaps you want a portfolio of your photography, an online CV with demos of your work, or maybe you just want a small single page site with a little bit of text. In the end, what you decide upon will determine how much work and time is required to get your site up and running, so itâ€™s best to answer sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em>Donâ€™t rush, take your time. Think about it over a cup of tea or coffee, Iâ€™ll still be here when youâ€™ve decided</em>.</p>

<p>If after such contemplation you have decided you only want/need a single page thatâ€™s awesome. This will be much quicker and easier for you. Iâ€™d recommend checking out Githubâ€™s very own <a href="www.google.com">step-by-step guide</a>. It contains everything you need to get your site up and running using one of their curated single page jekyll themes. Follow this and youâ€™ll have your content hosted in no time.</p>

<p>For my Blog, Portfolio and CV peeps</p>
