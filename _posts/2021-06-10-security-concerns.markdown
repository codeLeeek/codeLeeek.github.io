I've been in the IT industry for around eight years now, the last two working with Security. Looking back with a Security lense I begin to realise I've only ever really considered two major groups when it comes to security stakeholders, the users of the product and the corporate assets. To be fair I'm relatively new to security but of all the blogs, articles, podcasts, security standards and even legal requirements I've encountered over the last couple of years very few tend to consider the seemingly forgotten stakeholder, everyone else. 

But lets take a step a back. What do I mean by "everyone else" as a security stakeholder?

### Analogy time. 
Think about buying a car. Before you decide on which car you want, you will likely consider several things: 

**Where will you store it?** : In a Garage/Carport? Shared car pack? On the street? When asking these questions you're essentially considering how to protect your investment. These are your company or corporate security concerns. 

**How safe is it?**: Does it have airbags? Seat-belts? Stability Control? Crumple zones? By asking these questions you're considering how to protect the driver and passengers of the car. These are primarily your user security concerns.

But what about pedestrians and other road users? The people that will never user your car but can still be very much affected if something goes wrong. More importantly, have you taken them into consideration when buying a car? 

### Enough with the self-aggrandising nonsense!
Alright, ok, please forgive my over indulgence. Essentially what I'm trying to say is how often do we consider the people that aren't directly involved with the service or product we work on? In my career I've only really ever thought about security stakeholders as the company, staff, clients, service providers and users; not so much for those who may just be visiting or simply perceive the brand as legitimate. 

 To be clear I'm not suggesting this is a new revelation, certainly not my idea. In fact I only started thinking about this when I came across Troy Hunt's blog post around the importance of https.

### So how do we think about security for everyone else?
That's a good question, and it isn't so much about new things do we have to do to protect everyone else but rather, when assessing and remediating risk thinking about how the identified vulnerablity can affect everyone else, not just our key stakeholders.

To see how this can work in practice let's take a look at some common vulnerabilities through the lense of how it can affect those stakeholders that aren't our immediate user base and how it could affect them.

#### HTTPS & HSTS headers

#### Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

#### Invalid DMARC & Phishing

#### Sub-domain takeovers
